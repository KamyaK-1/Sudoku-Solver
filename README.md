This project has 2 parts:

i) Implementing a sudoku puzzle solver and generator using the old-school backtracking algorithm.  
ii) Implementing a solver using a Sequential API of Keras.

To run the second part of this project, you would need to download [sudoku.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/sudoku) dataset
